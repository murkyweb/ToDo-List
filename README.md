# ToDo-List

A page which lets you create multiple to-do lists, made with HTML, CSS, JS and bundled with Webpack.

Working on this project made me more comfortable with using classes, modules and the module pattern. I also learned how to work with a JSON object and how to store data on the user's end using the Web Storage API. I tried to follow OOP principles as much as I could, especially the Single Responsability Principle.

This project was created for the [Todo List assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) as part of The Odin Project.
